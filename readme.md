# Multiplayer game server bot

A Discord bot to manage active self-hosted dedicated game servers for the
community.

Implemented specifically for our needs so that I could better understand async
Rust. However, I thought it worth making public as an example for anyone looking
to do something similar.

## Overview

Description of need, discord server, LGSM, wine, dedicated linux game servers,
etc...

## Implementation details

Tokens, `GameServer` trait, `GAME_SERVERS` array, discord API details

## Work-in-progress

- Implement a logger
